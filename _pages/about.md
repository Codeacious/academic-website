I'm a sixth-year PhD student working with [George Porter](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gmporter/).
My academic interests include datacenter networking, traffic control, environmental computing, and ecological conservation.
<!-- My goal is to develop new methods of communication that push for overall sustainability
and enable new technologies for wildlife recovery. -->

I received B.S. and M.Eng. degrees in Computer Science at Cornell University.

My personal interests include hiking, boardgames, and tea! I also volunteer at
the [California Wolf Center](https://www.californiawolfcenter.org/), performing animal care.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com){:target="\_blank"}. You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
